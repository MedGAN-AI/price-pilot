# PricePilot Project README

> We’re a team of innovators setting sail on an adventure to build PricePilot—from first spark of an idea to a production-ready dynamic pricing engine that delights merchants. Let this document be our shared map, charting every twist, turn, and triumph along the way.

---

## 1. The Vision: Why We’re Here
We saw a gap: many Jordanian SMEs struggle with manual price updates, losing revenue and margin. PricePilot will **automate pricing** using data-driven demand forecasting, price elasticity modeling, and real-time market signals. Our north star metrics:
- **Revenue uplift**: +5–15% for merchants
- **Margin improvement**: +3–8%
- **Time saved**: 80% reduction in manual pricing overhead

This vision unites us and guides every design decision.

## 2. Our Technology Compass
We’ll stitch together best‑in‑class open‑source and cloud tools:
| Layer               | Technology                         | Purpose                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Data Ingestion      | Apache Kafka, AWS S3               | Stream and store raw sales/competitor data |
| Data Processing     | Apache Spark, Pandas               | Cleanse, aggregate, feature engineering  |
| Modeling & Training | scikit‑learn, XGBoost, Prophet     | Demand forecasting & elasticity models   |
| MLOps & CI/CD       | MLflow, GitHub Actions, Docker     | Versioning, automated training pipelines |
| API & Services      | FastAPI, AWS Lambda                | Expose pricing recommendations           |
| Front‑end Dashboard | React (RTL support), Tailwind CSS  | Merchant UI for insights & overrides     |
| Monitoring & Alerts | Prometheus, Grafana, AWS CloudWatch| Model drift detection, system health     |

This stack ensures scalability, reliability, and rapid iteration.

## 3. Implementation Workflow: The Journey Unfolds
We break our quest into five interlinked phases. Each phase builds on the last, creating momentum and shared wins.

### Phase 1: Data Quest
- **Objective**: Assemble and understand our raw materials—sales history, competitor prices, promotions, seasonality signals.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define data schemas and contracts with SMEs.  
  2. Build Kafka topics and S3 landing zones.  
  3. Prototype Spark jobs for cleansing and basic aggregation.  
  4. Deliver a sample dataset and exploratory analysis report.
- **Outcome**: Trusted dataset, clear data dictionary, and initial EDA insights.

*Leads into Phase 2 by providing the cleaned features needed for modeling.*

### Phase 2: Modeling Magic
- **Objective**: Develop and validate forecasting & elasticity models.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Engineer time‑series features (lags, rolling stats).  
  2. Train baseline models (ARIMA, Prophet) for demand forecasting.  
  3. Implement XGBoost regression for price elasticity estimation.  
  4. Cross‑validate and compare models; select champions.  
  5. Document model performance, assumptions, and limitations.
- **Outcome**: Two production‑ready models with performance reports and model cards.

*Feeds Phase 3: we’ll package these models into reproducible pipelines.*

### Phase 3: Pipeline & MLOps Forge
- **Objective**: Automate model training, versioning, and deployment.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Containerize model code with Docker.  
  2. Define MLflow experiments and register models.  
  3. Create GitHub Actions workflows: data pull → train → test → register.  
  4. Deploy to staging with Kubernetes/ECS and run smoke tests.  
  5. Set up drift monitoring alerts in Grafana.
- **Outcome**: Fully automated CI/CD for model updates, with rollback safety nets.

*Prepares Phase 4 by giving stable endpoints for pricing queries.*

### Phase 4: API & Dashboard Odyssey
- **Objective**: Expose pricing recommendations and let merchants interact.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Design FastAPI endpoints for single and bulk price recommendations.  
  2. Implement authentication and audit logging.  
  3. Build a React dashboard: real‑time charts, override controls, scenario simulation.  
  4. Conduct usability testing with pilot merchants.  
  5. Iterate UI/UX based on feedback.
- **Outcome**: A sleek, user‑friendly portal where merchants see and tweak prices.

*Leads to Phase 5 for production hardening and monitoring.*

### Phase 5: Launch & Beyond
- **Objective**: Roll PricePilot into production and ensure continuous value.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Migrate staging to production environment.  
  2. Onboard first 5 pilot customers; provide training sessions.  
  3. Monitor KPIs: revenue uplift, response times, system uptime.  
  4. Collect feedback and prioritize backlog for v2 features (e.g., promotion optimization).
  5. Establish a quarterly cadence for model retraining and feature updates.
- **Outcome**: Live service delivering measurable impact; roadmap for future growth.

## 4. Connecting the Dots: How Phases Relate
- Data Quest fuels Modeling Magic with clean features.  
- Modeling Magic outputs models that Pipeline & MLOps Forge operationalizes.  
- The API & Dashboard Odyssey surfaces model outputs to end users.  
- Launch & Beyond closes the loop: real‑world feedback refines our data collection and modeling assumptions.

Each phase is a chapter in our story—progressing from raw data to real impact.
